# Lab 10 Doubly Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues and Binary Searches

## Overview

This is a demonstration of implementation of several data structures and a search method with a big O of O(log(n)) (in time-complexity; it has an O(1) in space-complexity) where n is the length of the input array.

## Getting Started

To get started using this application, familiarity with node and npm, as well as git is assumed. Fork/clone this repo to your machine, and do an `npm install`. As jest is currently installed as a Dev Dependency, make sure to do an `npm i jest` also. To run the tests to see that the implementation of the data structures is successful with real-world examples, run `npm run test`.
